[Daniel Lemire's](https://lemire.me/blog/) blog is full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in data processing. This repo contains Rust implementations of some of them. I'm using ARM NEON intrinsics (they are built-in my MacBook Pro), and displaying the result of the benchmark on my laptop as a comment at the top of the source files.

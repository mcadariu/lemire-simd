[Daniel Lemire's](https://lemire.me/blog/) blog is full of common problems and (very) efficient solutions (most often SIMD-based) encountered in the data processing domain. I'm reimplementing a couple of them in Rust, to get the hang of they work, and see if I can distill some repeatable patterns. I'm using ARM NEON intrinsics (they are built-in my MacBook Pro). I'm capturing and displaying the result of the benchmark on my laptop as a comment at the top of the source files.
